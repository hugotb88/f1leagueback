    # Define the steps for the job
    steps:
    
    # 1. Checkout the source code
    - name: Checkout Repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v4

    # 2. Set up Java 17 environment
    - name: Set up JDK 17
      uses: actions/setup-java@v4
      with:
        # Specifies the Java version
        java-version: '17'
        # Specifies the Java distribution (e.g., Temurin, Adopt, Zulu)
        distribution: 'temurin'
        # Enables caching for Maven dependencies (~/.m2/repository)
        cache: 'maven'

    # 3. Build and Test the project with Maven
    - name: Build and Run Tests
      # The '--batch-mode' flag prevents interactive prompts
      # 'verify' phase compiles, runs tests, and checks results
      run: mvn --batch-mode --update-snapshots verify

    # 4. (Optional) Upload the resulting JAR/WAR artifact
    # This is useful if you want the artifact to be available for review or a later CD step
    - name: Upload Artifact
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
      with:
        # The name under which the artifact will be stored
        name: microservice-artifact
        # Path to your compiled jar/war file (adjust the path if necessary)
        # This assumes a typical Maven target directory structure
        path: target/*.jar
        # Retention period in days (optional)
        retention-days: 5
